    <h1>HTML and CSS: The Building Blocks of the Web</h1>
    <p>HTML and CSS are two of the most fundamental technologies that are used to create websites. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard<br/> markup language used to create web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. Together, these two technologies<br/> form the building blocks of the web.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML: The Structure of a Web Page</h2>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that is used to structure the content of a web page. The language consists of a set of tags that are used to define <br/>the different elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, because it does not have the ability to perform calculations or create complex algorithms.<br/> Instead, it is used to describe the structure and content of a web page.</p>
    <p>The basic structure of an HTML document consists of a set of tags that define the beginning and end of different sections of the document. The most <br/>basic HTML document consists of an opening and closing tag for the &lt;html&gt; element, which contains the entire document, and within that, opening and closing tags for the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. <br/>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information about the document, such as the title, and<br/> the &lt;body&gt; element contains the content of the document.</p>
    <p>One of the main advantages of HTML is its simplicity. The language is easy to learn, and the basic elements of an HTML document are straightforward<br/> and easy to understand. However, HTML can be extended with additional features and attributes that make it more powerful and versatile. For example, HTML5 includes new elements that make it easier <br/>to embed video and audio content in a web page, as well as elements for creating forms and other interactive content.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS: The Look and Feel of a Web Page</h2>
    <p>While HTML is used to define the structure and content of a web page, CSS is used to define its visual style and layout. CSS is a style sheet<br/> language that is used to describe the presentation of an HTML document, including its colors, fonts, and layout.</p>
    <p>The basic structure of a CSS document consists of a set of rules that define how different elements of an HTML document should be styled. <br/>Each rule consists of a selector, which specifies the element to be styled, and one or more declarations, which specify the style properties to be applied to the element. CSS allows web designers to create<br/> rich, visually appealing designs for their web pages. By separating the content and structure of a web page from its visual style,<br/> CSS makes it easier to create consistent and professional-looking designs, and to make changes to the visual style of a web page without affecting its content or structure.</p>
    <p>CSS also supports responsive design, which is an approach to web design that focuses on creating web pages that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.<br/> With CSS, designers can create different stylesheets for different screen sizes, and use media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size of the device being used to<br/> view the web page.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS work together to create the web pages that we see and use every day. HTML defines the structure and content of the web page, <br/>while CSS defines its visual style and layout. The two technologies are complementary, and web designers must understand both in order to create effective and visually appealing designs.</p>
